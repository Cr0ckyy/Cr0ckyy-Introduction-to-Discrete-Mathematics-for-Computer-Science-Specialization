# To find the remainders of the given divisions, we will use the modulo operator (%).

# 1. The remainder of 23 divided by 5
remainder_23_5 = 23 % 5

# 2. The remainder of 138 divided by 13
remainder_138_13 = 138 % 13

# 3. The remainder of -33 divided by 7
# In Python, the sign of the remainder is the same as the sign of the divisor.
remainder_neg33_7 = -33 % 7

# Print the results neatly on separate lines
print("1. The remainder of 23 divided by 5 is:", remainder_23_5)
print("2. The remainder of 138 divided by 13 is:", remainder_138_13)
print("3. The remainder of -33 divided by 7 is:", remainder_neg33_7)
