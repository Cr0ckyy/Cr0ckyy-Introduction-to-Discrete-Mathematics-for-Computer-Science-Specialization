# Step 2: Function to check if equal chances can be provided for all eaters
def can_provide_equal_chances(question):
    # Calculate the total probability
    total_probability = sum(question['probabilities'])

    # Check if the total probability can be evenly divided among the people
    return total_probability % question['people'] == 0


# Step 3: Iterate over the questions and check if equal chances can be provided
for question in questions:
    print(f"{question['question']}: {can_provide_equal_chances(question)}")

# Mathematical Calculations:
# For Question 1: The outcome "1 or 2" has probability 1/10+2/5=0.1+0.4=0.5.
# For Question 2: The probabilities of individual outcomes are finite decimal fractions, so the probability of any event (their sum) is also a finite decimal fraction, so we cannot get 1/3=0.33333... exactly.
# For Question 3: You need to get groups of size 1/4, 1/3 (and 1/2 is automatic: 1/4+1/4=1/2). Can you see how to do this? Cut a unit interval into three or four equal pieces.
# For Question 4: Check your suggestion carefully
